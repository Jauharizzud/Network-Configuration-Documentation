# Cisco VLAN Trunking Configuration

This repository contains a basic VLAN trunking configuration between Cisco switches and/or switch-to-router (Router-on-a-Stick) using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## üìå Configuration Summary

* VLAN10 and VLAN20 are created on each switch
* Trunk ports are manually configured (static trunk)
* Access ports are assigned to specific VLANs
* Verified using `show` commands:

  * `show vlan brief`
  * `show interfaces trunk`
  * `show running-config`

## üîß Sample Trunk Configuration

```
! On SW1 and SW2 - Trunk port configuration
interface FastEthernet0/5
 description Trunk to SW2
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

```
! Access port for VLAN10 on SW1
interface range FastEthernet0/1-2
 description PC in VLAN10
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
```

```
! Access port for VLAN20 on SW1
interface range FastEthernet0/3-4
 description PC in VLAN20
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Extras

* Console and VTY password configured
* `service password-encryption` enabled
* Disabled DNS lookup (`no ip domain-lookup`)
* Warning banner (MOTD) set

## üß™ Testing Tips

* Test connectivity using `ping` between PCs on different switches and VLANs
* Make sure trunk ports are UP and VLANs are allowed
* Use `show cdp neighbors` to verify physical connections
